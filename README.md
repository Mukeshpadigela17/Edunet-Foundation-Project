Project Title: Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Description:
The Water Quality Prediction project aims to evaluate and predict the potability or pollution levels of water using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical water quality data, the model identifies key chemical indicators like pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, phosphates, and more to determine the safety of water for consumption or usage.

Objectives:
Analyze historical water quality datasets.

Identify patterns and correlations among chemical parameters.

Build predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify water as potable or non-potable.

Visualize water quality trends and important features.

Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data processing)

Scikit-learn (model building)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (interface, if deployed)

Skills Learned:
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and selection

Model training and evaluation

Real-world dataset handling

Basic deployment (optional)
